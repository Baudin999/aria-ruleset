Paladins are holy warriors. They are specialized in the eradication of evil like demons and undead. There are three paths a paladin can follow and every level they gain they should choose one spell from that level of any path. 
Level 5 is a big step in the paladin's abilities. At level 5 you select a specialization. Choosing this specialization unlocks perks you can choose from within the \emph{tree of perks}.

Every paladin starts with the following three spells:

\begin{itemize}
\item Regenerate: 1 life per recuperation. (+1 per level), this ability is always active on the paladin.
\item Protect: +1 armor, always on.
\item Destroy evil: +2 DMG against undead and demons. This spell is always on. If you even “shake the hand of an undead” you will deal 2 DMG and will know it’s a demon.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

At level 10 every branch gets a protector. A protector is a clone of yourself. You can do everything twice.

Unless stated otherwise every spell the paladin can choose from is an instant cast, has a cooldown of 50 INI and lasts the entire combat.
