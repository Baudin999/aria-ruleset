\subsection{Warriors}

Warriors are the masters of a battlefield. They dominate a battle with strength and tactics. There are three types of warriors: Barbarians, Soldiers and Defenders.

Barbarians are brutal fights, thriving on the pain a battle brings, rage and bloodlust fueling their every action and spurring them on. Barbarians fight with brutal attacks. Soldiers are tactical fighters, making sure that everyone is in the right position and empower those who need it with commands and battle shouts. Defenders take damage, they can keep standing when other would have given up.
Every warrior starts with one of the following three abilities:

\begin{itemize}
\item Barbarian: +1 DMG, +5\% crit chance.
\item Soldier: -1 AP cost for def actions, recovery grants 1 extra AP.
\item Defender: -1 AP cost for def actions, +1 armor.
\end{itemize}

When you play a warrior you choose a path and stick to it.
